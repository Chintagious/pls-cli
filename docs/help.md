There are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).

And there are several ways to get help too.

## ⭐️ **PLS-CLI** in GitHub

You can "star" in GitHub (clicking in the star button at the top right):
<a href="https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli" target="_blank">https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli</a>.

## 👀 Watch the GitHub repository for releases

You can "watch" **PLS-CLI** in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right):

<a href="https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli" target="_blank">https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli</a>.

By doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of **PLS-CLI** with bug fixes and new features.

## 🔭 Watch the GitHub repository

* Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
